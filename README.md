Hi, I’m Meghan.

Back in 2004 I took a programming class as a freshman in high school and I've been hooked on anything tech related ever since. I'm currently an IT Manager overseeing sytems as processes for endpoint device enviornments, but I'm looking to expand my horizions and refresh my coding skills.
